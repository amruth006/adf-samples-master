This project has JDBC connection pooling disabled by setting the configuration
parameter jbo.maxpoolsize=0 as a Java VM command line parameter.

It also has the jbo.server.internal_connection configuration
property to a JDBC URL connection string that will be used for state
management persistent storage.
